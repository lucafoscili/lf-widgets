LF Widgets is a lightweight and versatile Web Components library designed to enhance your web development experience.

Built with modern standards and best practices in mind, LF Widgets offers a collection of reusable components that can seamlessly integrate into any web project, regardless of the framework or vanilla JavaScript setup.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

#### 1. Install Yarn

If you haven't installed Yarn yet, get it done with:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Or check out [Yarn's installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for more options.

#### 2. Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

Clone this repo and install everything in one go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-widgets.git
cd lf-widgets
yarn install
```

#### 3. Run the Showcase

Fire up the showcase to view the webcomponents:

```bash
yarn dev:setup
```

That's it!

---

### Usage

After installing, you can import and use LF Widgets components in your project. Here's a quick example of how to use the `<lf-button>` component directly in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>LF Widgets Example</title>
    <script
      type="module"
      src="./path/to/@lf-widgets/framework/dist/framework/lf-framework.esm.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      type="module"
      src="./path/to/@lf-widgets/core/dist/lf-core/lf-core.esm.js"
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <lf-button lf-label="Click me!" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Make sure to replace the paths with the actual locations of the LF Widgets packages in your project.

The event handling is wrapped in a single event, emitted by the root element. In this small example we add a listener to the button component, performing different actions for different situations:

```javascript
const myButton = document.createElement("lf-button");

myButton.addEventListener("lf-button-event", (e) => {
  const { eventType } = e.detail;

  switch (eventType) {
    case "click":
      console.log("Click!");
      break;
    case "blur":
      console.log("Blur!");
      break;
    case "ready":
      console.log("The button is ready!");
      break;
    case "unmount":
      console.log("The button has been removed from the DOM!");
      break;
  }

  document.body.appendChild(myButton);
});
```

### Initializing LfFramework

LF Widgets ships with a small singleton “core” (`LfFramework`) that underpins theming, portals, debugging features, and more. The singleton must be initialized manually. This is an architectural choice to avoid global state and ensure that the core is only created when needed. In addition, by initializing the core early, you can set up theming and other features before components are rendered to avoid flickering.

Below is the **recommended** pattern, using this function exported by the `@lf-widgets/framework` package:

- **`getLfFramework()`**  
  Returns the LfFramework instance, initializing it if necessary.

#### Example

```ts
// In your top-level code or a dedicated file
import { getLfFramework } from "@lf-widgets/core";

// Elsewhere, in a component or function:
function doSomething() {
  const framework = getLfFramework();
  framework.assets.set("https://example.com/assets");
  framework.theme.set("dark");
  // ...
}
```

### LfMessenger

<div align="center">

![LfMessenger](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lucafoscili/blob/ea30fd47b149048b96d0a1388f724d6690e20a82/lf-widgets/screenshots/messenger.jpg)

</div>

**Description:**  
Provides a customizable chat interface for interactive roleplay or AI-driven conversations. Users can define a JSON dataset of characters and initiate dynamic dialogues through a third-party API (OpenAI compatible endpoint required).

**Features:**

- Dynamic list of characters generated from a JSON dataset.
- Interactive chat interface.

**Note:**  
A functional local endpoint is required for chat functionality. If the endpoint is offline, the chat interface will remain static.

## Contributing

If you discover a new bug or have an exciting idea for a new component, feel free to open an issue or a discussion! Check out the [issues](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-widgets/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-widgets/discussions) tabs to see how you can get involved.

Pull requests are also welcome if you want to contribute firsthand. Just clone the repository and run from the root:

```sh
yarn install
```

Then build the library with the command:

```sh
yarn build
```

Finally, you can launch the development environment with the command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Sass / Styling Guidelines

The project uses **Sass Modules** only. Legacy `@import` is forbidden (enforced by `yarn lint:scss-modules`).

Guidelines:

1. Prefer `@use` for consuming, `@forward` for re‑exporting.
2. Place all `@use` statements at the very top of the file.
3. Never use `@use "..." as *` when bringing in multiple partials that expose the same configurable variables (e.g. `$comp`). Provide short, unique namespaces instead.
4. Any variable meant for configuration via `with (...)` must be declared with `!default` in the partial (example: `$comp: null !default;`).
5. Aggregator files should contain only `@forward` statements—no styles, no mixin calls.
6. If a refactor introduces shared utilities, add them to an appropriate forwarded index rather than creating new global side‑effects.

Run the validation locally:

```sh
yarn lint:scss-modules
```

If it fails, replace remaining `@import` with proper `@use` / `@forward` equivalents.

## A `Comfy` Marriage

LF Widgets forms the backbone of [LF Nodes for ComfyUI](https://github.com/lucafoscili/comfyui-lf), a suite of custom nodes designed for **ComfyUI** workflows. This integration showcases the power and flexibility of web components, making it clear just how effortless it is to introduce new widgets into complex systems.

**Why it works:**

- **Simplicity:** Adding a new widget feels as natural as snapping pieces together.
- **Style:** The sleek design of LF Widgets components enhances any workflow.
- **Scalability:** The flexibility of web components ensures seamless integration, even as workflows grow more complex.

And… they look fantastic in action!

### Transition from Ketchup Lite

LF Widgets originates from a fork of [Ketchup](https://github.com/smeup/ketchup). While Ketchup provided a strong foundation, LF Widgets has been completely reimagined with a focus on:

- **Modern Aesthetics**: Adopting a sleek, glassmorphism-inspired design.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Simplified components with streamlined theming and events.
- **Unique data structure**: Each component relies on the same JSON structure.
