## Monorepo Structure

The LF Widgets library is organized as a monorepo managed by Yarn and Lerna. The following diagram shows the high-level folder structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[lf-widgets]
    A --> B[packages]
    B --> C[assets]
    C --> C1[assets/]
    C1 --> C2[fonts/]
    C1 --> C3[showcase/]
    C1 --> C4[svg/]
    B --> D[core]
    D --> D1[dist/ (Stencil build output)]
    B --> E[foundations]
    E --> E1[dist/ (TSC build output)]
    B --> F[framework]
    F --> F1[dist/ (Stencil build output)]
    B --> G[react-core]
    B --> H[react-showcase]
    B --> I[showcase]
    I --> I1[src/ (index.html & entry files)]
    I --> I2[vite.config.mjs]
    A --> J[node_modules]
```

## Packages Overview

Each package in the monorepo serves a specific role:

### Root Package

- **Purpose:**  
  Acts as a container for the Yarn & Lerna workspace. It aggregates the various packages, defines global devDependencies and scripts, and provides build orchestration.
- **Key Points:**
  - Private repository.
  - Defines workspace boundaries and manages cross-package dependencies.

---

### Assets

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/assets`
- **Purpose:**  
  Centralizes static resources (SVG icons, fonts, and media for the showcase) used by the library.
- **Key Points:**
  - Exports a folder structure of assets.
  - Acts as a static repository that can be consumed by other packages, primarily the framework.

---

### Foundations

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/foundations`
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides types, constants, and core utilities without introducing any runtime dependencies.
- **Key Points:**
  - Built with TypeScript (`tsc`).
  - Supplies contracts and shared definitions consumed by downstream modules (framework, core, etc.).
  - Acts as the foundation for consistency across the library.

---

### Framework

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/framework`
- **Purpose:**  
  Serves as the core orchestrator of the LF Widgets library. It handles theming, asset management, module registration, and sets up global event listeners.
- **Key Points:**
  - Built with Stencil.js (even though it does not rely on Stencil decorators like `@Component`).
  - Exposes a singleton-like instance through the `getLfFramework()` function.
  - Allows registration of submodules via the `register` method.
  - Initializes global state (e.g., sets a symbol on the `window` object and dispatches a custom event when ready).
- **Example Initialization Snippet:**

  ```typescript
  import { getLfFramework } from "@lf-widgets/framework";

  const lfFramework = getLfFramework();
  // lfFramework is now available for module registration and asset management.
  ```

- **Internal Architecture:**  
  The main class (`LfFramework`) initializes various sub-modules (e.g., color, data, debug, drag, effects, llm, portal, theme, utilities) and sets up global listeners to manage interactions (like click callbacks). Its design facilitates:

  - **Asset Management:** Each module can have its own asset management functions (`getAssetPath`, `setAssetPath`).
  - **Module Registration:** Additional modules can be registered at runtime.
  - **Event Dispatching:** Global events are dispatched once the framework is ready, allowing components to safely wait for initialization.

---

### Core

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/core`
- **Purpose:**  
  Contains the main library of web components built with Stencil.js.
- **Key Points:**
  - Components in this package are built using Stencil and rely on the framework for runtime dependencies.
  - Uses a standardized pattern to wait for the framework readiness (via promises exported by the foundations).
- **Component Lifecycle Example:**

  ```typescript
  async componentWillLoad() {
    this.#framework = await awaitFramework(this);
    // Continue with the component's initialization...
  }
  ```

- **Documentation Generation:**  
  Includes scripts (e.g., `doc`) that generate documentation for the components.

---

### Showcase

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/showcase`
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides an interactive showcase to display the components in a real-world scenario. It also renders the documentation generated by the core package.
- **Key Points:**
  - Built with Stencil.js.
  - Utilizes Vite as the development server for faster builds.
  - Integrated with Cypress for e2e testing to ensure component functionality.

---

### React-core

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/react-core`
- **Purpose:**  
  Acts as a bridge between the Stencil components and React applications.
- **Key Points:**
  - Built with TypeScript.
  - Exports Stencil-based components as React components.
  - Depends on `@lf-widgets/core` and the `@stencil/react-output-target` package for proper integration.

---

### React-showcase

- **Package Name:** `@lf-widgets/react-showcase`
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides a React version of the showcase, allowing users to interact with the components in a React context.
- **Key Points:**
  - Built with TypeScript.
  - Exports the showcase component as a React component.
  - Relies on the Stencil showcase and bridges it using React integration libraries.

---

## Inter-Package Relationships

The following diagram illustrates how the different packages depend on and interact with one another:

```mermaid
graph TD
    F[Foundations]
    FR[Framework]
    C[Core]
    S[Showcase]
    RC[React-core]
    RS[React-showcase]
    A[Assets]

    F --> FR
    F --> C
    FR --> C
    A --> FR
    C --> S
    C --> RC
    S --> RS
```

**Notes:**

- **Foundations** is the base for both the **Framework** and **Core** packages.
- **Framework** orchestrates and exposes runtime functionality used by **Core** and indirectly by **Showcase**.
- **Assets** are used by the **Framework** for centralized asset management.
- **Showcase** leverages **Core** for component rendering and is also used for testing.
- The React counterparts (**React-core** and **React-showcase**) wrap their Stencil-based versions for seamless integration with React projects.

## Framework Initialization Flow

The LF Widgets framework is designed to be initialized on demand. The following flowchart summarizes the steps taken when the `getLfFramework()` function is invoked:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[getLfFramework() called]
    B{lfFramework already exists?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return existing lfFramework instance]
    B -- No --> D[Call initLfFramework()]
    D --> E[Create new LfFramework instance]
    E --> F[Call finalize() on the new instance]
    F --> G[Set global window[LF_FRAMEWORK_SYMBOL]]
    G --> H[Call markFrameworkReady()]
    H --> I[Dispatch CustomEvent (LF_FRAMEWORK_EVENT_NAME)]
    I --> C[Return newly created lfFramework instance]
```

**Key Points:**

- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures only one instance of the framework is created.
- **Global Exposure:** The instance is attached to the `window` object for global accessibility.
- **Event Dispatching:** A custom event notifies any listeners that the framework is ready, enabling dependent components to safely execute initialization code.

---

## Build & Testing Scripts

The root `package.json` defines several scripts that coordinate the build, test, and development processes across packages:

- **Build Scripts:**
  - `build:core`, `build:foundations`, `build:framework`, etc., which use Lerna to run package-specific builds.
  - The `build` script orchestrates the entire build process across all packages.
- **Development & Testing:**
  - `dev` and `dev:setup` scripts for running the showcase in development mode.
  - Cypress is used for running e2e tests against the showcase to ensure all components work as expected.
  - The `doc` script generates documentation from the core package.

These scripts help maintain consistency and ensure that changes in one package are correctly integrated and tested across the entire library.

## Conclusion

The LF Widgets library is a modern, modular system for building web components with Stencil.js. Its architecture is characterized by:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each package has a distinct responsibilityâ€”from foundational types and constants to runtime orchestration and component rendering.
- **Dynamic Framework Initialization:** The framework is initialized on demand, providing flexibility in how and when global state and event listeners are set up.
- **Seamless React Integration:** React-core and React-showcase bridge the gap between Stencil web components and React applications.
- **Robust Development & Testing Tools:** A comprehensive set of build and test scripts ensure high quality and maintainability.

By following this architecture, the LF Widgets library achieves a scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly codebase that is both efficient in development and robust in production.
